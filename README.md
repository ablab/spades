# About SPAdes

SPAdes is a versatile toolkit designed for assembly and analysis of sequencing data.
SPAdes is primarily developed for Illumina sequencing data, but can be used for IonTorrent as well. Most of SPAdes pipelines support hybrid mode, i.e. allow using long reads (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore) as a supplementary data.

SPAdes package contains assembly pipelines for isolated and single-cell bacterial, as well as metagenomic and transcriptomic data.
Additional modes allow to discover bacterial plasmids and RNA viruses, as well as perform HMM-guided assembly.
Besides, SPAdes package includes supplementary tools for efficient k-mer counting and k-mer-based read filtering, assembly graph construction and simplification, sequence-to-graph alignment and metagenomic binning refinement.

# Quick start

- Complete user manual can be found [here](https://ablab.github.io/spades/). Information below is provided merely for your convenience and cannot be considered as the user guide.

- SPAdes is an assembler for second-generation sequencing data (Illumina or IonTorrent). PacBio and Nanopore reads are supported *only* as supplementary data. SPAdes can assemble genomes, metagenomes, transcriptomes, viral genomes etc. 

- Download SPAdes binaries for Linux or MacOS [here](https://github.com/ablab/spades/releases/latest/). You can also compile SPAdes from [source](https://github.com/ablab/spades/releases/latest/) (requires g++ 9.0+, cmake 3.16+, zlib and libbz2). SPAdes requires only Python 3.8+ to be installed.

- Test your SPAdes installation by running

```
    bin/spades.py --test
```

- A single paired-end library (separate files, gzipped):

```
    bin/spades.py -1 left.fastq.gz -2 right.fastq.gz -o output_folder
```


- IonTorrent data:
```
    bin/spades.py --iontorrent -s it_reads.fastq -o output_folder
```

- A paired-end library coupled with long PacBio reads:

```
    bin/spades.py -1 left.fastq.gz -2 right.fastq.gz --pacbio pb.fastq -o output_folder
```

- Available assembly modes: `--isolate`, `--sc`, `--plasmid`, `--meta`, `--metaplasmid`, `--metaviral`, `--rna`, `--rnaviral`,  `--bio`, `--corona`, `--sewage`.

- Standalone tools in SPAdes package: k-mer counting, k-mer cardinality estimation, k-mer-based read filtering, assembly graph construction, assembly graph simplification, alignment of long reads to an assembly graph, refinement of metagenomic binning.
