title: Building lexy and integrating it in your own projects
---
:toc: left
:toclevels: 1

The library uses CMake (3.8 or higher) as its build system.
It requires a compiler that supports {cpp}17, but works best with {cpp}20.
It is tested with GCC 7 and higher, clang 6 and higher, the latest MSVC and clang-cl.
Other compilers may work as well.

== Basic integration

The recommended way to integrate lexy is using https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html[`FetchContent`].
This will automatically download the library and make it available in your CMake project.

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(lexy URL https://lexy.foonathan.net/download/lexy-src.zip)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(lexy)
```

lexy will detect when it is used via `FetchContent` (or `add_subdirectory`) and automatically disable project infrastructure like tests or examples.
It exposes the following targets:

`foonathan::lexy::core` (header-only)::
  lexy's core library; it is required.
  It is an `INTERFACE` target that sets the required include path and {cpp} standard flags.
`foonathan::lexy::file` (library)::
  Link to this library if you want to use {{% docref "lexy::read_file" %}} and other file I/O functions.
`foonathan::lexy::unicode` (header-only)::
  Link to this library if you want to use advanced Unicode rules that require the Unicode character database.
`foonathan::lexy::ext` (header-only)::
  Link to this library if you want to use the extension headers in `lexy_ext/`.
`foonathan::lexy` (library)::
  Umbrella target that links to all other targets.

A minimal `CMakeLists.txt` that uses lexy can look like this:

.`CMakeLists.txt`
```cmake
project(lexy-example)

include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(lexy URL https://lexy.foonathan.net/download/lexy-src.zip)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(lexy)

add_executable(lexy_example)
target_sources(lexy_example PRIVATE main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(lexy_example PRIVATE foonathan::lexy)
```

== Configuration

lexy can be customized by two CMake flags set at build time:

`LEXY_FORCE_CPP17`::
  If this option is `ON`, linking against `foonathan::lexy::core` (and transitively also `foonathan::lexy`) sets the flag to enable {cpp}17 for all compilers.
  If this option is `OFF`, linking enables {cpp}20 for compilers that support it and {cpp}17 otherwise.
  It is `OFF` by default.
`LEXY_USER_CONFIG_HEADER`::
  This setting defines the file path to the user config header file (see below).

All other configuration happens via the user config header, which is a user-written file that can be used to override many of the automatic compiler detections.
If `LEXY_USER_CONFIG_HEADER` is set, it will use the specified header; otherwise, looks for a header file named `lexy_user_config.hpp` somewhere in the include search path.
This header is then automatically included by lexy and can define macros to customize lexy.
Those are:

`LEXY_ENCODING_OF_CHAR`::
  The encoding that lexy will deduce for `char` strings.
  By default, it is {{% docref "lexy::default_encoding" %}}, which means any 8bit encoding.
  It can be overridden to {{% docref "lexy::ascii_encoding" %}} or {{% docref "lexy::utf8_encoding" %}}.
`LEXY_ENABLE_ASSERT`::
  Whether or not internal assertions and precondition checks are enabled.
  By default, they are enabled unless `NDEBUG` is defined.
`LEXY_HAS_NTTP`::
  Whether or not the compiler supports {cpp}20's generalized non-type template parameters.
`LEXY_HAS_CONSTEVAL`::
  Whether or not the compiler supports `consteval`.
`LEXY_HAS_CHAR8_t`::
  Whether or not the compiler supports `char8_t`.
`LEXY_IS_LITTLE_ENDIAN`::
  Whether or not the native endianness is little endian.
`LEXY_FORCE_INLINE`::
  The compiler specific attribute to force inlining.
`LEXY_EMPTY_MEMBER`::
  The compiler specific attribute for `[[no_unique_address]]`.

== Development build

To contribute to lexy, you don't want to use it as a subdirectory as that disables most targets.
Instead, clone the project normally and use CMake directly (i.e. `cmake -S /path/to/lexy -B /path/to/build`).
This requires at least CMake 3.18.

=== Development target

The special target `foonathan::lexy::dev` can be used instead of `foonathan::lexy::core`.
It will enable the relevant compiler warnings inside the lexy headers.
Link against it in any examples or tests.

NOTE: It is not part of the umbrella target `foonathan::lexy`.

=== Examples

Examples are only available if `LEXY_BUILD_EXAMPLES` is `ON` (the default).
Each example has its own target, e.g. `lexy_example_calculator`.

=== Tests

Tests are only available if `LEXY_BUILD_TESTS` is `ON` (the default).
It will automatically fetch doctest and `enable_testing()`.

The following test targets are available:

`lexy_test`::
  Tests for all headers in `lexy/`.
`lexy_ext_test`::
  Tests for all headers in `lexy_ext/`.
`lexy_test_XXX`::
  Tests for example `XXX`.
`lexy_test_playground`, `lexy_test_godbolt`, `lexy_test_godbolt_examples`, `lexy_test_playground_examples`::
  Compile-only targets that ensure the examples of the documentation all compile.

The minimal workflow to build lexy and run all tests is:

```
cmake -S /path/to/lexy -B /path/to/build
cd /path/to/build
cmake --build .
ctest
```

=== Benchmarks

Benchmarks are only available if `LEXY_BUILD_BENCHMARKS` is `ON` (not the default).
It will automatically fetch nanobench and necessary data files.
Refer to the `benchmarks/` folder for details.

=== Docs

Docs can only be built if `LEXY_BUILD_DOCS` is `ON` (not the default).
It requires that you have installed https://gohugo.io/[hugo], https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor], and https://github.com/pygments/pygments.rb[pygments.rb].
Docs can be build by two targets:

`lexy_docs_serve`::
  This will compile the docs and serve the website on localhost.
`lexy_docs`::
  This will compile the docs into `docs/public`.

=== Packaging

lexy also exposes a custom target `lexy_package`.
It will create a file `lexy-src.zip` in the build directory containing all source files necessary for downstream users to use lexy.
