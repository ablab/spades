<h1>QUAST manual</h1>

<p>QUAST stands for QUality ASsesment Tool. QUAST is intended to evaluate genome assemblies by computing various metrics (e.g., N50, number of ORFs, etc.). 
QUAST was tested on single-chromosomal reference genomes and may not work well on the multi-chromosomal ones. 
<br>
This manual will help you to run the tool and understand its output. QUAST is distributed within SPAdes release. 
See <a href="manual.html">SPAdes manual</a> for download and installation details.
<br>
QUAST uses <a href="http://www.plantagora.org/">Plantagora</a> and <a href="http://mummer.sourceforge.net/">MUMmer</a>.

<h2>1. Running QUAST</h2>

<a name="sec1.1"></a>
<h3>1.1 Input data</h3>
<p>
    QUAST can work with assemblies and references in FASTA format. Files may be compressed with gzip.    
<br><br>
    You can specify files with genes and operons annotations. This files should be either in GFF format 
(<a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/gff/spec.html">version 2</a> and <a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml">version 3</a> 
are supported) or in plain TXT format with 4 tab-separated columns: 
<ul>
    <li>the chromosome name (it should match the exact string in the reference file), </li>
    <li>gene or operon id, </li>
    <li>start position,</li> 
    <li>end postion.</li>
</ul>
The coordinates are 1-based and if <i>start postion</i> less than <i>end postion</i> than that gene or operon is on the positive strand, 
otherwise it is on the negative strand.
<br><br>
You can find example of reference file, genes and operons annotations (both in TXT and GFF ver.2 formats) in your SPAdes installation directory in the subdirectory <code>test_dataset</code>. 
These files are correspond to the toy dataset distributed with SPAdes (first 1000 bp of E. coli).

<h3>1.2 Command line options</h3>

<p>
    QUAST is run from the command line as follows:
</p>

<pre class="code">
<code>
    quast.py [options] &lt;contig_file(s)&gt;
</code>
</pre>

    <p>Here is available options:</p>

<p>
    <code>-o &lt;output_dir&gt; </code></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specify the output directory. The default value is <code>results_&lt;date_time&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
    <code>-R &lt;filename&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File with reference genome. Most metrics can't be evaluated without reference.</p>

<p>
    <code>-G &lt;filename&gt;</code> (or <code>--genes &lt;filename&gt;</code>)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File with genes annotations for given species. See details about file format in <a href="#sec1.1">section 1.1</a></p>

<p>
    <code>-O &lt;filename&gt;</code> (or <code>--operons &lt;filename&gt;</code>)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File with operons annotations for given species. See details about file format in <a href="#sec1.1">section 1.1</a></p>

<p>
    <code>--min-contig &lt;int&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sets the lower threshold for contig length. Only contigs of length &ge; the threshold will be taken into account 
(except of some metrics, see <a href="#sec2">section 2</a>). The default value is 0.</p>

<p>
    <code>--contig-thresholds &lt;int,int,...&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comma-separated list of contig length thresholds. Used in <b><i># contigs &ge; x</i></b> and 
<b><i>Total length (&ge; x)</i></b> metrics (see <a href="#sec2">section 2</a>). The default value is 110,201,501,1001.</p>

<p>
    <code>--orf &lt;int,int,...&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comma-separated list of threshold lengths (in codons) of ORFs to search for. Used in <b><i># contigs &ge; x</i></b> metrics 
(see <a href="#sec2">section 2</a>). The default value is 200 (i.e. 600 bp).</p>

<p>
    <code>--not-circular</code>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flag should be set if genome is NOT the circular one (e.g., it is an eukaryote).</p>

<p><code>-h</code> (or <code>--help</code>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Print help.</p>

<h2>2. Understanding the output</h2>

<p>QUAST computes various metrics and this section is intendend to describe them. 
<br>
Values of main metrics are presented in the file <code>&lt;QUAST_output_dir&gt;/report.txt</code>. 
There is also tab-separated version of this file in <code>&lt;QUAST_output_dir&gt;/report.tsv</code> (suitable for Google-docs).
<br>
Plots are presented in the file <code>&lt;QUAST_output_dir&gt;/plots.pdf</code>.
<br><br>
Note:
<ul>
    <li>plots will be created only if you have <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">matplotlib</a> python library installed,</li>
    <li>metrics based on reference genome are computed only if reference is given (see  <a href="#sec1.2">section 1.2</a>), </li>
    <li>metrics based on genes and operons are computed only if proper annotations files are given (see <a href="#sec1.2">section 1.2</a>), </li>
    <li>if the output directory is not specified manually it is created automatically and symbolik link <code>latest</code> to that directory is created.</li> 
</ul>

<h3>2.1 Metrics descriptions</h3>

<p><b><i># contigs &ge; x</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is the total number of contigs of length <code>&ge; x</code>. 
This metric doesn't depend on <code>--min-contig</code> command line parameter (see <a href="#sec1.2">section 1.2</a>).</p>

<p><b><i>Total length (&ge; x)</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is the total number of bases in contigs of length <code>&ge; x</code>. 
This metric doesn't depend on <code>--min-contig</code> command line parameter (see <a href="#sec1.2">section 1.2</a>).</p>

<br>
<i>
All remaining metrics are computed on the contigs of length <code>&ge; x</code> where <code>x</code> is specified in command line option 
<code>--min-contig</code> (see <a href="#sec1.2">section 1.2</a>, default is 0).
</i>
<br>

<p><b><i>N50</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is the contig length such that using longer or equal length contigs produces half (50%) the bases of
the assembly. Usually there is no value that produces exactly 50%, so the more technical definition is
the minimal length x such that using contigs of length at least x accounts for at least 50% of the total
assembly length.</p>

<p><b><i>NG50</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is the contig length such that using longer or equal length contigs produces half (50%) the bases of
the reference genome. This metric could be computed only if the reference is given.</p>

<p><b><i>N75 and NG75</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; are defined similarly with 75% instead of 50%.</p>

<p><b><i>Number of contigs</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is the total number of contigs in the assembly.</p>

<p><b><i>Largest contig</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is the length of the longest contig in the assembly.</p>

<p><b><i>Total length</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is the total number of bases in the assembly.</p>

<p><b><i>Reference length</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is the total number of bases in the reference.</p>

<p><b><i>Average %IDY</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is the average of alignment identity percent (i.e. alignment accuracy) among all contigs.</p>

<p><b><i>Misassemblies</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; gives the number of positions at the assembled contigs where the left flanking sequence
aligns over 1kb away from the right flanking sequence on the reference or they overlap on more than 1 kb or flanking sequences align 
on different strands. This metric could be computed only if the reference is given.</p>

<p><b><i>Misassembled Contigs</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is the number of contigs that contain misassembly events.</p>

<p><b><i>Misassembled Contig Bases</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is the number of total bases contained in all contigs that have one or 
more misassemblies.</p>

<p><b><i>Misassembled and Unaligned</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; the number of contigs which contain misassembly
events but which have alignment to the reference of length less than 10% of contigs length (almost unaligned contigs). </p>

<p><b><i>Unaligned Contigs</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; the number of contigs that have no alignment to the
reference sequence. The value "X + Y part" means: X totally unaligned contigs plus Y partially unaligned contigs. </p>

<p><b><i>Unaligned Contig Bases</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; the total number of unaligned bases in totally and 
partially unaligned contigs (only bases from unaligned parts). </p>

<p><b><i>Ambiguous Contigs</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; the number of contigs which have reference alignments
of equal quality in multiple locations on the reference. The value "X (Y)" means X ambiguous contigs with Y bases in them. </p>

<p><b><i>NA50, NGA50, NA75, NGA75 (A stands for "aligned")</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; like the same
metrics without A but in this case we count lengths of aligned blocks instead of contigs lengths. 
I.e. if a contig has a misassembly with respect to the reference, we break the contig into smaller pieces.
Also, if a contig has bases that don't align to the reference, they are not counted in NAx, NGAx. </p>

<p><b><i>Mapped genome (%)</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; the ratio of total number of aligned bp in the assembly
to the genome size. Short contigs (less than 500 bp) that map to multiple
places may be counted many times in this quantity.  A base in the genome is
counted as aligned one if there is at least one contig with at least one
alignment with this base. </p>

<p><b><i>Genes</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; the number of genes in the assembly (full and partial), based
on the positions the contigs map to in the reference genome with an annotated list of genes. The value "X + Y part" 
means X full genes and Y partial ones (at least 100 bases are aligned). 
This metric could be computed only if the reference and genes annotations file are given (see <a href="#sec1.2">section 1.2</a>).</p>

<p><b><i>Operons</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is defined similarly to the previous metric but you need 
operons annotations file for computing this metric. </p>

<p><b><i># ORFs >= x bp</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; is the total number of Open Reading Frames of length <code>&ge; x bp</code> founded in the assembly 
(the length of one codon is 3 bp). This metric will be computed if genes annotations file is not given.</p>

<h3>2.1 Plots descriptions</h3>

<p><b><i>Cumulative length</i></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plot shows the growth rate of assemblies lengthes. The y-axis is the size of assembly and x-axis is the number of contigs in the assembly
(from the largest one to the smallest one). </p>

<p><b><i>Nx</i></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plot shows the changes of Nx metric value in dependence of x value. The y-axis is the Nx value and x-axis is the x value. </p>

<p><b><i>NGx</i></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plot is similar to the previous one but for NGx metric.</p>

<p><b><i>Cumulative length (aligned contigs)</i></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plot is similar to <b><i>Cumulative length</i></b> plot but we plot only aligned contigs instead of contigs itself. 
If a contig has a misassembly with respect to the reference, we break the contig into smaller pieces. This plot could be created only if the reference is given. </p>

<p><b><i>NAx and NGAx</i></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These plot are similar to the <b><i>Nx</i></b> and <b><i>NGx</i></b> plots but for NAx and NGAx metrics respectively. 
These plots could be created only only if the reference is given.</p>

<p><b><i>Genes</i></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plot shows the growth rate of full genes in assemblies. The y-axis is the number of full genes in the assembly and 
x-axis is the number of contigs in the assembly (from the largest one to the smallest one). 
This plot could be created only if the reference and genes annotations file are given.</p>

<p><b><i>Operons</i></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plot is similar to the previous one but for operons. </p>
